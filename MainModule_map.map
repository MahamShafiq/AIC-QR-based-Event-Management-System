Phase 2.7  Design Feasibility Check
WARNING:Place:916 - Local congestion has been detected on component
   AGM/addrb<5>. There is a limitation that at most 2 global signals can drive
   non-clock pins per CLB. The placer has detected that component AGM/addrb<5>
   has 3 non-clock pins driven by global signals. Placement will continue but
   note that this situation may lead to an unroutable situation.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
